# Definitions

Cohesion: readibility and easy understanding of code.

Rules:
- Fuctions do one thing and return one thing
- Names make sense and are easily understandable


Coupling: how deep and integrated your code is tied together.

Rules:
- Some coupling is necessary but make it to where a function receives the data it needs and is not embedded in the function.
- Move functions that are tightly coupled to the class or object where it belongs
